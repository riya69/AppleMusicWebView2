# Fork Information
Main changes are (as of writing):

- Darker UI (some colors haven't been replaced though)
- Cleaned up some code
- Switched from a red/pink-ish color on the text on the side, to a green-blue color

All credits still goes to the original developer for making this possible (btw Apple, fix iTunes so it isn't so unstable and maybe people will use it)
